So far, I've created a test table called movies. I struggled with getting the local server and db set up with the command line. I eventually got things up and running in pgAdmin so my db is local to my machine at the moment.

The starting tutorial, which is this code line by line, is from https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-a-rest-api-application-using-golang-and-postgresql-database/. I am using this code to learn and will edit this code later for a personal project. I may also use it to create something new.
